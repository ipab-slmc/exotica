#11/2/2014
-> Fixed buildTree function to allow keeping the root node
-> Debugged seg-fault in the addSegment function (was not checking whether parent exists for desired root node)
-> Removed potential for seg-fault in the setEndEffectors function (was not checking that segments passed actually exist and that seg_offsets was indeed filled before dereferencing)
-> Added print robot function (recursive): seems to be working ok even when I change root...

#25/2/2014
-> Adding support for Prismatic joints: doing my own enum type so that I am forced to process joints as they come in...
