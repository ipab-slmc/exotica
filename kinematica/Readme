Root is guaranteed to be the first element stored

Talk about different getPose() functions

Jacobian order same as joints_update

Not entirely fool-proof: especially when computing FK and so I do not yet check the correct setting of initialisation

Not sure about the KDL definition of origin: whether it is the transform from origin to the actual joint or vice versa (need to check this as operations might need to be inverted)

Known Limitations:
  1) Not sure how it works for linear joints... Need to fix this!!!!!
  
  
First some design decisions
   Thread Safety
   Private/Public
   Memory access vs computation
